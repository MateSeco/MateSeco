#Hi!

I'm starting in web development and learning JavaScript based technologies.
I particularly like React.
I leave here links to some of the projects I've been working on:

* [fakeTwitter](https://github.com/MateSeco/ejercicio_twitter_react_front)
* [Shop lists](https://github.com/MateSeco/ListasCompras)
* [Página para una confitería](https://github.com/MateSeco/Confiteria)
* [e-commerce](https://github.com/mikaela-regalado/ElectroHack-client)
