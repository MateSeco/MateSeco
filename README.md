### Hi there :wave:!

I'm starting in web development and learning JavaScript based technologies.
I particularly like React.
I leave here links to some of the projects I've been working on, they all've been deployed with Vercel:

* [fakeTwitter](https://github.com/MateSeco/ejercicio_twitter_react_front)
* [Shopping lists](https://github.com/MateSeco/ListasCompras)
* [Patisserie Webpage](https://github.com/MateSeco/Confiteria)
* [e-commerce](https://github.com/mikaela-regalado/ElectroHack-client)
